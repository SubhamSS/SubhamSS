### Hi there 👋

<p>I am Subham, an aspiring roboticist   <img src=https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/04/03/11/55/robot-312566_960_720.png width="30"></br>
<p>I am a Masters student at Virginia Tech. I love building robots and am currently a graduate researcher at the Vibrations and Robotics Lab @ Virginia Tech. I am interested in Controls, Planning and Software development for robotics. I work with the mechanical, electrical and software development of the robot. I am also a huge fan of motorsports, cars and pizza! When free, I am busy planning my next cross-country road trip!
  
👩‍💻 My interests include robot motion planning and control
